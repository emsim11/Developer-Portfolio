# Blogs Public Directory

The `Blogs` Public Directory stores all of the markdown files that are listed and displayed on the Blog Page of my portfolio website.

Note that images that are used within blog posts are stored at `/Public/Images`.

The top of each file must contain the following metadata:

```MDX
---
Title: ''
Subtitle: ''
Date: 'DD-MM-YYYY'
Display: 'true' | 'false'
---
```
