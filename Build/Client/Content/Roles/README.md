# Roles Public Directory

The `Roles` Public Directory stores all of the markdown files that are listed and displayed on the Experience Page of my portfolio website.

Every company should have its own subdirectory. Each subdirectory should contain a `Responsibilities.md` file, which describes my role within the company. This information should be outlined as bullet points and broken down into `Technical Skills`, `Soft Skills`, `General`, etc. if need be.
